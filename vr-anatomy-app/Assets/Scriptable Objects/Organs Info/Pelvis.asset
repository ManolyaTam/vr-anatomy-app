  description: The pelvis is a bony structure located at the base of the spine, connecting
    the trunk and the legs. It consists of the hip bones (ilium, ischium, and pubis),
    sacrum, and coccyx. The pelvis supports the weight of the upper body when sitting
    and standing, and it provides attachment points for various muscles and ligaments
    involved in movement and stability. Additionally, the pelvis houses and protects
    reproductive organs and parts of the digestive and urinary systems.
