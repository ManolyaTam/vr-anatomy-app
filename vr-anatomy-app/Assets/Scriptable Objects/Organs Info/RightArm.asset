  description: The right arm is a highly versatile limb composed of several key segments.
    It starts at the shoulder, a ball-and-socket joint allowing for a wide range
    of motion. The upper arm contains the humerus bone, facilitating movements through
    muscles like the biceps and triceps. The elbow, a hinge joint, connects the upper
    arm to the forearm, enabling bending and extending motions. The forearm consists
    of the radius and ulna bones, which contribute to the rotation of the wrist and
    hand. The wrist, made up of carpal bones, links the forearm to the hand, providing
    flexibility and dexterity. The hand itself comprises metacarpals and phalanges,
    allowing for intricate movements and manipulation of objects. Together, these
    parts enable a wide variety of functions essential for daily activities.
