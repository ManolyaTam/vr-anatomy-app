  description: The skull is a complex structure of bones forming the head in vertebrates.
    It provides protection for the brain, supports the structures of the face, and
    forms the framework for the jaws. Comprised of 22 bones, including the cranium
    and facial bones, the skull plays a crucial role in protecting sensory organs
    and enabling various functions such as eating, breathing, and communication.
