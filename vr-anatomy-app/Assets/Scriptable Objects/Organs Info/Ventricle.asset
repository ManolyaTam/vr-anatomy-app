  description: 'The ventricles are a set of four interconnected cavities within the
    brain that produce and contain cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). These include two lateral
    ventricles, the third ventricle, and the fourth ventricle. The ventricles are
    essential for protecting the brain by cushioning it, removing waste, and providing
    nutrients. They play a crucial role in maintaining the brain''s environment and
    ensuring its proper function. '
