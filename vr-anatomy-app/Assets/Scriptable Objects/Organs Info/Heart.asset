  description: 'The heart is a muscular organ located in the chest cavity, responsible
    for pumping blood throughout the body. It consists of four chambers: two atria
    and two ventricles. The heart''s rhythmic contractions maintain blood circulation,
    delivering oxygen and nutrients to tissues and removing waste products. It plays
    a crucial role in the cardiovascular system, working continuously to ensure that
    all body parts receive an adequate blood supply to function properly.'
