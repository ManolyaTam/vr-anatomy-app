  description: The sinuses are air-filled cavities located within the bones of the
    skull and face. They include the frontal, maxillary, ethmoid, and sphenoid sinuses.
    These cavities are lined with mucous membranes that help humidify and filter
    the air we breathe, lighten the weight of the skull, and enhance our voices.
    Sinuses also play a role in the immune response by trapping and clearing pathogens
    and debris from the nasal passages.
