  description: The chest, or thorax, is a vital area of the body that houses key
    organs and structures. It includes the rib cage, which is composed of ribs and
    the sternum, providing protection for the heart and lungs. The ribs are connected
    to the spine at the back and curve around to the front, offering structural support
    and aiding in breathing. The chest muscles, primarily the pectoral muscles, facilitate
    movements of the shoulder and arm and assist in respiration. The diaphragm, a
    crucial muscle located at the bottom of the chest cavity, plays a significant
    role in breathing by contracting and expanding the lungs. Together, these components
    of the chest ensure protection for vital organs, support for upper body movement,
    and essential respiratory functions.
