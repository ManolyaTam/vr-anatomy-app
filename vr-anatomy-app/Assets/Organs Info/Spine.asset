  description: The spine, a vital component of the skeletal system, consists of 33
    vertebrae arranged into cervical, thoracic, lumbar, sacral, and coccygeal regions,
    providing support, flexibility, and protection to the body. The cervical spine
    supports the head's movement, while the thoracic spine anchors the rib cage,
    and the lumbar spine bears significant weight and allows for mobility. Intervertebral
    discs cushion the vertebrae, and the spinal cord housed within transmits nerve
    signals. Below, the pelvis, comprising the hip bones, sacrum, and coccyx, provides
    a sturdy foundation for the spine, supporting the upper body and serving as an
    attachment point for muscles. It sustains body weight during activities like
    standing and walking, while also safeguarding internal organs. The hip joints
    facilitate leg movement, emphasizing the pelvis's integral role in locomotion
    and overall bodily function.
