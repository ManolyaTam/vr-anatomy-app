  description: The head is the uppermost part of the body, housing critical sensory
    organs and the brain. It includes the skull, a bony structure that protects the
    brain and supports the structures of the face. The face comprises the eyes, ears,
    nose, and mouth, which are essential for vision, hearing, smell, and taste, respectively.
    The brain, located within the cranial cavity, is the control center of the body,
    responsible for processing sensory information, regulating bodily functions,
    and enabling cognition and emotion. The head also contains muscles that control
    facial expressions and mastication (chewing). Together, these components allow
    for sensory perception, communication, and vital neurological functions.
