  description: Innards refer to the internal organs of the body, collectively known
    as viscera, which are housed within various cavities such as the thoracic cavity
    and abdominal cavity. These organs perform vital functions necessary for survival
    and homeostasis. The thoracic cavity contains organs such as the lungs, which
    facilitate respiration and circulatory functions. The lungs exchange oxygen and
    carbon dioxide during breathing. In the abdominal cavity, organs like the stomach,
    liver, intestines, and kidneys aid in digestion, metabolism, filtration, and
    waste elimination. The stomach breaks down food, the liver detoxifies substances,
    the intestines absorb nutrients, and the kidneys filter blood and regulate fluid
    balance. Additionally, the reproductive organs, including the ovaries and uterus
    in females and the testes in males, play essential roles in reproduction and
    hormone regulation. Overall, the innards collectively ensure the proper functioning
    and maintenance of bodily processes, contributing to overall health and well-being.
