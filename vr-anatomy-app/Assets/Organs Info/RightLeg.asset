  description: The right leg is a powerful and essential limb comprised of several
    key segments. It begins at the hip, a ball-and-socket joint that allows for a
    wide range of movement. The upper leg contains the femur, the longest and strongest
    bone in the body, which connects to the knee. The knee is a hinge joint that
    enables bending and straightening of the leg. The lower leg consists of the tibia
    and fibula bones, which support weight and facilitate movement. The ankle, a
    complex joint made up of the talus and other bones, connects the lower leg to
    the foot, providing stability and flexibility. The foot, composed of tarsals,
    metatarsals, and phalanges, allows for balance, walking, and a wide range of
    motions. Together, these parts enable standing, walking, running, and many other
    activities crucial for mobility and daily life.
